# Intermediate-Machine-Learning
Machine Learning Intermediate is a repository that contains Python file related to intermediate-level machine learning techniques. The contents of this repository are a part of my journey in learning machine learning on Kaggle.

## Contents
* **Missing Values** 
> In this section, I've covered various techniques to deal with missing values in datasets.
* **Categorical variables**
> This section covers different methods to handle categorical variables in datasets.
* **Pipelines**
> Here, I've demonstrated how to build pipelines to automate machine learning workflows.
* **Cross-validation** 
> This section covers the importance of cross-validation and how to implement it in machine learning models.
* **XGBoost**
> In this section, I've covered the XGBoost algorithm and how it can be used to improve the accuracy of machine learning models.
* **Data Leakage**
> This section covers the concept of data leakage and how to avoid it in machine learning.

## Libraries Used

* **pandas: ** A popular library for data manipulation and analysis.
* **scikit-learn (sklearn):** A machine learning library that provides a wide range of tools for building predictive models.
## Usage

* Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
* Open the Python files in your preferred IDE.
* Install the required libraries (pandas, sklearn) using pip or conda.
* Run the code in your IDE to see the results.

## Getting Started:

> Familiarity with Python programming language and basics of machine learning is required to understand the contents of this repository.
Install Python 3.x and an IDE of your choice (such as Anaconda, Spyder, or PyCharm).
Install the required libraries (pandas, sklearn) using pip or conda.
Start by running the code in the "Missing Values" folder to learn about different techniques for handling missing data.
